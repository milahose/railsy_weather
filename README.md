# Railsy Weather
## A weather app using the Open Weather API and Ruby on Rails

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have written some test before starting development. I would also spend a lot more time on the front-end, making it more "pretty" and user-friendly. I would also like to change the API call to include a 5-day forecast and allow the user to switch between fahrenheit and celsius. I would also like to include some graphics or images based on the weather conditions, however Open Weather's images are quite ugly and don't really match the conditions, and I did not have time to find new images and write out the logic for when they should be displayed.
